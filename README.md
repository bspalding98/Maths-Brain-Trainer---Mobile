# Maths-Brain-Trainer---Mobile
This was a University project in my final year of studies where I had to create a mobile application that uses the phones accelerometer 
to play a maths brain trainer where you tilt the phone to choose the correct answer and advance through stages.

The project has a few little bugs and things that were not quite finished like:
- The tutorial video was just a random video to showcase the functionatlity works, it just needs a new mp4
- The leaderboard only holds 10 and prints the table again

Below is a Demo of the project:
