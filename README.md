# Maths-Brain-Trainer---Mobile
This was a University project in my final year of studies where I had to create an educational mobile application that uses the phones accelerometer. 
I decided to make a Maths Brain Trainer game where there are stages of an additon equation with 4 answers. To choose an answer you need to tilt the phone
in the desired direction.

The project has a few little bugs and things that were not quite finished like:
- The tutorial video was just a random video to showcase the functionatlity works, it just needs a new mp4
- The leaderboard only holds 10 and prints the table again

Below is a Demo of the project:
